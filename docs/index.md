## Description
Welcome to my Rat Rig Mods page.

## My Setup
I've designed all these mod around my Rat Rig V-Core3.  Its a custom size at 400x by 400y by 500z.  My toolhead is an EVA2.4 with a BondTech LGX, Mosquito Magnum and a CHT nozzle.

I have no plans to enclose my printer at this time and I don't even have an electronics panel.  All my electronic components are mounted on DIN rails.  I used the Rat Rig designed Y endstop block to secure the DIN rails to the 3030 extrusions allowing my to adjust the rails up or down as needed.

## My Stuff

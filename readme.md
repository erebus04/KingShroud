## Description
This is my Voron Stealthburner inspired shroud for the EVA carriage platform created by [Pawe≈Ç Kucmus](https://main.eva-3d.page/).  This shroud should be a drop-in replacement for any EVA 2.4 shroud.  This shroud features a hidden ADXL345 mount, dual Neopixel RGB LEDs for seeing what you're printing and a Neopixel RGB LED backlit EVA logo.
